# JuliaFinMetriX d3 charts

This repository is a library of reusable d3 charts. You can call these
charts from Julia with the *JFinM_charts* library.

# Gallery

I will include a thumbnail picture of each chart here in a gallery
table. For more information on each chart, simply take a look a the
respective bl.ocks.org page. bl.ocks.org gists can easily be made from
*JFinM_charts*.
